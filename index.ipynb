    "In this lesson, we shall look at the law of total probability. In probability theory, the law (or formula) of total probability is a fundamental rule relating **marginal probabilities** to conditional probabilities. It expresses the total probability of an outcome which can be realized via several distinct events, hence the name.\n",

    "* Understand and explain the concept of event space and partitioning \n",
    "* State the law of total probabilities based on a partitioned event space\n",
    "* Understand and able to perform partitioning based on known and unknown probabilities to solve a problem\n",

    "In a certain country there are three provinces; B1, B2, and B3 (i.e., the country is partitioned into three disjoint sets B1, B2, and B3). We are interested in the total forest area in the country. Suppose that we know that the forest area in B1, B2, and B3 are 100 km2, 50 km2, and 150 km2, respectively. What is the total forest area in the country? \n",

    "We can simply add forest areas in each province (known as a partition) to obtain the forest area in the whole country. This is the idea behind the law of total probability, in which the area of forest is replaced by probability of an event A. In particular, if you want to find P(A), you can look at a partition of S (our sample space), and add the amount of probability of A that falls in each partition. \n",

    "A lot of reasoning in probability theory involves decomposing a complicated event into simpler events, or decomposing complicated random variables into simpler ones like we saw in this simple problem above. Conditional probability is one way to do that, and it fits into this more general scheme of “decomposing” events and variables into components.\n",

    "* We can partition the natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ into even and odd numbers. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics choosing the right partitioning is key as bad choices of partitions may results in many, even more difficult to solve sub-problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The total probability law allows us to break up probability calculations into distinct parts. It’s used to find the probability of an event, A, when you don’t know enough about A’s probabilities to calculate it directly. Instead, you take a related event, B, and use that to calculate the probability for A.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The probability for a can be written as sums of event B. The total probability rule is:\n",
